Cornerstone is a set of JavaScript libraries that can be used to build web-based medical imaging applications. It provides a framework to build radiology applications such as the [OHIF Viewer](https://ohif.org/).

- **Fast:** Cornerstone leverages WebGL to provide high-performance image rendering and WebAssembly for fast image decompression.
- **Flexible:** Cornerstone provides APIs for defining custom image, volume, and metadata loading schemes, allowing developers to easily connect with proprietary image archives.
- **Community Driven:** Cornerstone is supported by the [Open Health Imaging Foundation](https://ohif.org/). We publish our roadmap and welcome contributions and collaboration.
- **Standards Compliant:** Cornerstone's core focus is Radiology, so it provides DICOMweb compatibility out-of-the-box.
