# @cornerstonejs/streaming-image-volume-loader

Cornerstone is a set of JavaScript libraries that can be used to build web-based medical imaging applications. It provides a framework to build radiology applications such as the [OHIF Viewer](https://ohif.org/).

This library, _@cornerstonejs/streaming-image-volume-loader_, provides a volume loader which allows for individual image slices (e.g. part of an MRI or CT acquisition) to be streamed in to fill an entire volumetric array. During this slice-by-slice streaming, the user can continue to interact with the volume.

You can find the Cornerstone documentation [on the website](https://cornerstonejs.org/).
