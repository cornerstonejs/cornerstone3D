# Help

We all need a little help sometimes. Don't let a few roadblocks stand in the way
of you building something awesome.

## Community Support

If you're a developer looking to contribute code, documentation, or discussion;
we are more than happy to help provide clarification and answer questions via
[GitHub issues][gh-issues]. You can also join our [Slack Group](https://ohif.org/community) or post on the [Community Forum](https://community.ohif.org/).

For bug reports and feature requests (including incomplete or confusing
documentation), [GitHub issues][gh-issues] continue to be your best avenue of communication.

Complex issues specific to your organization/situation are still okay to post,
but they're less likely to receive a response. Unfortunately, we have limited
resources and must be judicious with how we allocate them. If you find yourself
in this situation and in need of assistance, it may be in your best interest to
persue paid support.
