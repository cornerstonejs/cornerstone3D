# 5.x Migration Reference Notes

This page tracks smaller migration-impacting behavior changes that are useful
as reference during 4.x -> 5.x upgrades.

## `disableScale` and `imageFrame.preScale`

## What Changed

In 5.x, when `disableScale` is `true`, Cornerstone3D no longer sets
`imageFrame.preScale` and preserves the original pixel min/max range
(`minAfterScale = minBeforeScale`, `maxAfterScale = maxBeforeScale`).

This is intentional for cases where scaling is identity
(for example slope/intercept being 1/0).

## Why This Matters

In 4.x, some workflows implicitly relied on `imageFrame.preScale` always being
present. In 5.x, that object may be `undefined` when scaling is disabled.

## Migration Guidance

- Treat `imageFrame.preScale` as optional and guard access accordingly.
- If your downstream logic requires a pre-scale descriptor, create one in your
  application code when `disableScale` is enabled.
- If you only need pixel statistics, use `minPixelValue`/`maxPixelValue` from
  the image frame values directly instead of assuming post-scale values.

## `instance` data object model in metadata modules

### What Changed

In 5.x, this is primarily a documentation clarification rather than a new
runtime behavior change: `instance` data should be understood as a single
per-frame object that includes computed per-frame values merged into one object.

This object can use inheritance to compose values from multiple metadata levels.
Because of that, consumers should not assume all attributes are directly
iterable/enumerable on the object itself.

### 4.x vs 5.x interpretation

- **4.x:** this shape/behavior existed in practice, but was not clearly documented.
- **5.x:** the same model is now explicitly documented so integrations can rely
  on the intended contract.

### Migration Guidance

- Do not rely on object enumeration (`Object.keys`, `for...in`) to discover all
  available attributes on instance data.
- Access known attributes explicitly, or use module utilities that understand the
  composed/inherited object structure.
- When building instance data from naturalized metadata, prefer the
  `combineFramesInstance` utility so downstream modules receive the expected
  base object shape.
