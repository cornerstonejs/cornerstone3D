## Key Changes:

* MeasurementsReport has two maps instead of objects for setting the
  adapter classes, mapping the tool type to adapter class and the
  tracking id to adapter class.
* A new register additional tracking id method exists to allow adding
  custom adapter methods.
* Adapter implementations now have a base class to handle some of the
  definition.  This allows calling into the base class to handle some of the
  definition such as the is tracking handling.
* The MeasurementsReport class is now extensible to create a new class with
  completely different default handling.  To do this, the two map attributes
  need to be redeclared, and the new instance registered for the handlers.
* There is now an init method to create tracking identifiers and register a new
  handler.
* The annotation changed event no longer requires the viewport id/rendering id
   * This change is done so that measurements can be updated when not visible

## Migration Steps:

### 1. Replace MeasurementsReports.CORNERSTONE_TOOL_CLASSES_BY_UTILITY_TYPE

**Before:**
```diff
- const toolClass = MeasurementReports.CORNERSTONE_TOOL_CLASSES_BY_UTILITY_TYPE[toolType];
```

**After:**
```diff
- const toolClass = MeasurementReports.measurementAdapterByToolType.get(toolType);
```

### 2. Replace Tool instance adapter registration which is identical to existing registration

**Before:**
```diff
- class MyNewToolAdapter { ... identical to eg Probe Adapter }
```

**After:**
```diff
- const MyNewToolAdapter = Probe.initCopy('MyNewTool');
```

### 3. Replace old tool registration with registerTrackingIdentifier

**Before:**
```diff
- class OldToolAdapter { ... identical to eg Length v1.0 except has :v1.0 at end of tracking identifier }
```

**After:**
```diff
- MeasurementReport.registerTrackingIdentifier(Length, `${Length.trackingIdentifierTextValue}:v1.0`);
```
