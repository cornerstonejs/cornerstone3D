# Viewports

A viewport can be thought of as:

- A camera viewing an image from a specific perspective.
- A canvas to display the output of this camera.

In `Cornerstone3D` viewports are created from HTML elements, and the consumer should
pass the `element` for which the viewport should be created. For example, a CT series can be
viewed via 4 viewports in a “4-up” view: Axial MPR, Sagittal MPR, Coronal MPR, A 3D perspective volume render.

## StackViewport

- Suitable for rendering a stack of images, that might or might not belong to the same image.
- Stack can include 2D images of various shapes, size and direction

## VolumeViewport

- Suitable for rendering a volumetric data which is considered as one 3D image.
- Having a VolumeViewport enables Multi-planar reformation or reconstruction (MPR) by design, in which you can visualize the volume from various different orientations without addition of performance costs.
- For having image fusion between two series

## 3D Viewport

- Sutiable for actual 3D rendering of a volumetric data.
- For having different types of presets such as Bone, Soft Tissue, Lung, etc.

:::note

Both `StackViewport` and `VolumeViewport`, `VolumeViewport3D` are created via the `RenderingEngine` API.

## Initial Display Area

All viewports inherit from the Viewport class which has a `displayArea` field which can be provided.
This field can be used to programmatically set the initial zoom/pan on an image. By default, the viewport
will fit the dicom image to the screen. The `displayArea` takes a `DisplayArea` type which has the following
fields.

```js
type DisplayArea = {
  imageArea: [number, number], // areaX, areaY
  imageCanvasPoint: {
    imagePoint: [number, number], // imageX, imageY
    canvasPoint: [number, number], // canvasX, canvasY
  },
  storeAsInitialCamera: boolean,
};
```

Zoom and pan are all relative to the initial "fit to screen" view.

In order to zoom into the image 200%, we would set the `imageArea` to [0.5, 0.5].

Panning is controlled by a provided `imagePoint` and a provided `canvasPoint`. You can imagine the canvas as a sheet of white paper and the image as another sheet of paper like a chest x-ray. Mark a point in the canvas paper with a pen and then mark another point on your chest x-ray image. Now try to "pan" your image so the point so the `imagePoint` matches the
`canvasPoint`. This is what the API design of `imageCanvasPoint` represents.

Thus if you wanted to left align you image, you could provide the following value:

```js
imageCanvasPoint: {
  imagePoint: [0, 0.5], // imageX, imageY
  canvasPoint: [0, 0.5], // canvasX, canvasY
};
```

This means the left (0) middle (0.5) point on the canvas needs to align with the
left (0) middle (0.5) point on the image. Values are based on % size of the full image.
In this example, if we had a 1024 x 1024 x-ray image. The imagePoint would be [0, 512].
Let's say we were on a mobile iPhone in landscape mode (844 x 390). The canvasPoint would be [0, 195].
