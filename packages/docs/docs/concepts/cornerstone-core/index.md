# Core Introduction

This section describes the core concepts in the `Cornerstone3D` (`@cornerstonejs/core`).
`Cornerstone3D` is more than a "rendering" library. It handles:

- rendering of the image (both using GPU or CPU)
- caching of the data and metadata
- providing a framework for image/volume loader APIs
- providing metadata API support.

The purpose of this section is to give an overview of the core concepts in `Cornerstone3D`.
