# Streaming ImageVolume




- Streaming of Volume data
  - We have added a new volume loader which implements a progressive loading of volumes
    to the GPU. You don't need to wait for all of the volume to load to have an initial view. Below, you can see
    streaming of two volumes that are simultaneously loaded into the scenes for a 3x3 PET/CT fusion layout with a MIP view on the right.
