# Locking

Annotations can be locked to avoid accidental changes. You can use
the locking API to lock/unlock annotations.

## API

There are various APIs for locking and unlocking annotations along with get/set methods

```js
import { annotation } from '@cornerstonejs/tools';

// locking of an annotation
annotation.locking.setAnnotationLocked(annotation, (locked = true));

// get all the locked annotations
annotation.locking.getAnnotationsLocked();

// unlock all annotations
annotation.locking.unlockAllAnnotations();
```
