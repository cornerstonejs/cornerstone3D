## Event Listeners

The tools framework listens for “element enabled” events from the renderer. Event listeners are registered to each “enabled element”. Event listeners normalize native browser events, attach helpful data to each native event and trigger a custom event.

For example, a `cornerstonetoolsmouseclick` event is fired when a viewport is clicked. In this new version of the tool library, it will have an additional property (“renderer: ‘3D’”) attached to signify that it contains 3D information (i.e. world coordinates instead of image coordinates).

We intend to keep the same event names during migration so that it makes it easier for harmonizing the Cornerstone (legacy) and Cornerstone-3D together.
The library will otherwise emit the same events as the existing Cornerstone Tools, other than the following changes:


| Event name                       | Change  | Reason                                                                    |
|----------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cornerstonetoolsstackscroll      | Removed | Stack scroll is replaced by a "camera updated" event.                     |
| cornerstonetools3Dcameraupdated  | Added   | Fired on a camera update. The event detail contains the camera information. |
| cornerstonetoolsclipstopped      | Removed | CINE functionality is not currently in scope                              |
| cornerstonetoolslabelmapmodified | Removed | Labelmaps (segmentations) are not currently in scope                      |


## Schema Changes


The following table demonstrates some expected schema changes for events. The key differences are that:

- Several UIDs will function as lookup keys for core API methods (renderingEngineUID, sceneUID, viewportUID, volumeUID). This is similar to the “enabledElement” property currently provided in custom events, and can be used to obtain all of the imaging data that is being visualized.

- Snapshots of state at time of interaction return camera properties and coordinates in world space within the Scene's frame of reference.

A helper property to distinguish the renderer the event came from. Will be used in the future if other renderers are added to the framework (E.g. Cornerstone could be used in the same application for Ultrasound images, where volumes might not make sense).

## Event Dispatchers

Event Dispatchers will follow the same pattern as CornerstoneTools, in that there will be a centralized event dispatcher that decides whether a tool claims an event or not (necessary for supporting overlapping tools). Otherwise, the surface level API that the event dispatchers use to communicate with tools will be the same (e.g. tool.pointNearHandle and isPointNearTool). The implementations of these functions will need to take into account the 3D nature of the annotation though, and determining whether a tool is near the mouse cursor location will be left up to the tool implementation.
