# Volumes

A volume is a 3D data array that has a physical size and orientation in space. It can be built by composing pixel data and metadata of a 3D imaging series, or can be defined from scratch by the application. A volume has a `FrameOfReferenceUID`, `voxel dimensions (x,y,z)`, `origin`, and `orientation` vectors which uniquely define its coordinate system with respect to the patient coordinate system.
