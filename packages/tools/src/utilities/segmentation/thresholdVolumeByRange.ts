/**
 * It thresholds a segmentation volume based on a set of threshold values with
 * respect to a list of volumes and respective threshold ranges.
 * @param segmentationVolume - the segmentation volume to be modified
 * @param thresholdVolumeInformation - array of objects containing volume data
 * and a range (lower and upper values) to threshold
 * @param options - the options for thresholding
 * As there is a chance the volumes might have different dimensions and spacing,
 * could be the case of no 1 to 1 mapping. So we need to work with the idea of
 * voxel overlaps (1 to many mappings). We consider all intersections valid, to
 * avoid the complexity to calculate a minimum voxel intersection percentage.
 * This function, given a voxel center and spacing, calculates the overlap of
 * the voxel with another volume and range check the voxels in the overlap.
 * Three situations can occur: all voxels pass the range check, some voxels pass
 * or none voxels pass. The overlapType parameter indicates if the user requires
 * all voxels pass (overlapType = 1) or any voxel pass (overlapType = 0)
 *
 * @returns segmented volume
